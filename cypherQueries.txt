# 1. 3 most cited papers per venue

    Steps:
    1. 

# 2. Per venue (in general, not one specific edition), find the author community with authors that have published in 4 different editions of that venue

# 3. Find Impact Factor per Journal

    Steps: 
    1 Count all citings from 2023 for Papers published in 2022 and 2021 in the same Journal
    2. Count all papers, published in that journal in 2022, 2021
    3. divide the citings from 1. by the papers from 2. 

    Cypher Query for 2023:
    MATCH (citing:Paper)-[:CITES]->(cited:Paper)-[:PUBLISHED_IN]->(j:Journal)
    WHERE cited.year IN [2021, 2022] AND citing.year = 2023
    WITH j, COUNT(citing) AS totalCitations

    MATCH (j)<-[:PUBLISHED_IN]-(p:Paper)
    WHERE p.year IN [2021, 2022]
    WITH j.name AS journalName, totalCitations, COUNT(p) AS paperCount
    RETURN journalName, 
        totalCitations * 1.0 / paperCount AS impactFactor
    ORDER BY impactFactor DESC;

# 4. Find hIndex per Author

    Steps:
    1. Count the Papers, published by one author (h)
    2. Count the Papers by that author, with a citationcount >= h

    Cypher Query:
    MATCH (a:Author)-[:AUTHORED]->(p:Paper)
    WITH a.name AS authorName, collect(p.citationCount) AS citations

    // Sort and compute h-index
    WITH authorName, apoc.coll.sort(citations) AS sortedCitations
    WITH authorName, [i IN range(0, size(sortedCitations)-1) 
                    WHERE sortedCitations[-i-1] >= i+1 | i+1] AS hCandidates
    RETURN authorName, 
        CASE 
            WHEN size(hCandidates) = 0 THEN 0 
            ELSE max(hCandidates) 
        END AS hIndex
    ORDER BY hIndex DESC;
